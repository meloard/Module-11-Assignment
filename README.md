Module 11 Assignment - Note Taker - Creating a server and linking to built-front end

# Note Taker

## Description

Using an already built front-end, we created a server and set up the back end, so that a user can create and save notes! This excercise gave me some practice with proper linking and syntax within the server.js, including setting the port, and creating the get/post routes for the user. Overall it was good experience to see how the server connects, and how to filter/store the data that a user submits on the front-end
